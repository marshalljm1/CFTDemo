This project was constructed as part of a startup company that I consulted for.

It was designed to promote and sell pre-packaged charter bus tours and demonstrates usage of several different frameworks and techniques.


The core app was written in Xamarin and compiled to Android for use on tablets.  It leverages Autofac for dependency injection.

The app connected to a C# REST Api backend that uses Entity Framework Core with 
a repository pattern to enable collection-like access to datastores.
